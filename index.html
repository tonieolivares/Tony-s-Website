  <h3> <strong> About Me </strong> </h3>
  <p> Tony Olivares is a current student at <a href="https://www.andover.edu/"> Phillips Academy</a>, an independent boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts. Born in East Los Angeles, California, Tony attended public schools up until 9th grade, where he went across the country to attend boarding school. He enjoys playing basketball, and he has played for years. From city recreational leagues to travel ball teams, basketball was a large part of Tony's everyday life. Something he also enjoys but does not require nearly as much physical abiity is coffee. From espressos to Turkish Coffee, even to a plain cup of coffee, he lives for the taste of coffee.</p>
  <p> This website is where you can find Tony's computer science class work. From ethical reflections to <strong> even the website itself,</strong> this is a representation of Tony's work and understanding of the world of computer science. </p>
